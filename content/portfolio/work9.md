### Furniture crafts

Craft furniture is handmade furniture! It's not made by a machine! It's a craft, making hand made furniture! It takes a lot of different skills to make good furniture! You get good solid wood, it's heavy duty, and it will last forever, if you take good care of it! I love good sturdy furniture like they used to make back when I was a kid! You can't get any better than that! Thanks, take care, stay healthy,and safe
