Leatherwork is making items from leather (tanned animal skin). As with many crafts, there are a number of steps from the raw material – in this case a piece of leather – to a finished item. Leather craft involves designing, cutting, and then, depending on the project, hole punching, sewing, and finishing.

## Leather
Boiled leather, often referred to by its French translation, cuir bouilli (French: [kɥiʁ buji]), was a historical material common in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period and used for various purposes. It was leather that had been treated so that it became tough and rigid, as well as able to hold moulded decoration. It was the usual material for the robust carrying-cases that were made for important pieces of metalwork, instruments such as astrolabes, personal sets of cutlery, books, pens and the like. It was used for some armour, being both much cheaper and much lighter than plate armour, but could not withstand a direct blow from a blade, nor a gunshot.

Alternative names are "moulded leather" and "hardened leather". In the course of making the material it becomes very soft, and can be impressed into a mould to give it the desired shape and decoration, which most surviving examples have. Pieces such as chests and coffers also usually have a wooden inner core.
