        For people who choose Optimism and clothing you can go anywhere in.<br>
    We're a small but mighty team with Canadian roots, working on big things to make the<br><br> world a better place through our mission to Amplify Optimism.<br><br>
        In 2017, our CEO (Chief Executive Optimist) George Tsogas acquired Vancouver-based<br> Kit and Ace from its original founders, the Wilson family (previously of lululemon).<br><br>
        George was driven by a long-standing goal to lead an apparel brand — sparked by a<br> background in supply chain logistics, operations, and guest experience. Together 
        with<br> business partner Melissa Kinnoch (CFO), he evolved the company's history of premium<br> design and quality construction to refocus the brand’s direction towards 
        purpose-driven<br> apparel. In a market oversaturated by fast fashion, there was a clear appetite for<br> beautiful and highly versatile clothing that easily crosses seasons 
        and goes from<br> indoors to outdoors, boardrooms to beach</p>
